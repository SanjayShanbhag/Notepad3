# Notepad3
Notepad3 is a note taking application. It is a PWA and hence it works both offline and online.

This application requires that you create an account and login to create private note. However, you can easily create and share public notes without having to signup.

You can then just as easily login from any device and access all your notes. Also, you can opt to sync your notes offline, in which case your notes can be viewed without an internet connection.

Features Include:

1) Create and Share Public Notes

2) Login and Create Private Notes

3) Sync Notes For Offline Access

    Once done so, all your notes can be viewed offline. For security reasons, this doesn't happen automatically and has to be done by clicking on the "Sync Offline" button.

4) Create Private Notes in Offline Mode

    It will automatically be added to the servers when you have internet connection.

5) Edit in Offline Mode

    It will automatically be synced with the online version.


Also, if you are using this on a mobile device, you will get the option to add the app to your homescreen. Should you choose to do so, this application will be installed on your device and you will get a complete native application experience.
